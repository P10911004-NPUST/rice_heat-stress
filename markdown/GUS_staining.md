# GUS staining

> 1 mM X-Gluc  
50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (NA-P) (pH 7.0)  
7% methanol  
0.1% TritonX-100

The rice seedling were immersed in the GUS-staining solution and allowed the solution to penetrate completely into the tissue by a **vacumm infiltration (Jhenny: 30 mins)** and then **incubated at 37&deg;C in the dark** from 20 mins to overnight (maybe overnight) depending on the expression of the gene.  
Stained samples were destained in ethanol (for root, water is fine) until the chlorophyll was bleached.  
Thereafter observed under a dissection microscope.

<b><sup>1</sup> X-Gluc stock solution</b>  
Dissolved in DMF or DMSO, methanol (10 mg/mL), or ethanol (0.5 mg/mL).  
Prepare 100 mM stock solution on N,N,-dimethylformamide (DMF) and store at -20&deg;C.  

$$0.1\ M = \frac{\frac{x\ g}{444.6\ gmol^{-1}}}{0.01\ L}$$

$$x = 0.4446\ g = 444.6\ mg$$

> Dissolve **444.6 mg** X-Gluc in **10 mL** DMF

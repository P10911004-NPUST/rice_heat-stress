# DNA extraction
- take more time, but high concentration of DNA

> Caution: if directly powderized the sample with liquid nitrogen within the ependorf, 
after filling in the liquid nitrogen into the tube, 
DO NOT close the lid, the eppendorf will be exploded.

## Procedure:
1. Put two steel balls into each 1.5 mL eppendorf;

> - The steel balls must had been washed with 70% EtOH and autoclaved

2. Add 400 &micro;L <b style='color:orange'>DNA extraction buffer</b> into each eppendorf;

3. Directly submerge the samples into the DNA extraction buffer in each eppendorf;

4. Homogenize the samples and the buffer with a homogenizer;

> - <b>There are two containers for the homogenizer;</b>
> - each containers should be balanced (the amount and placement of the samples);
> - put a tissue on top of the eppendorfs' lid, this can prevent the solution seep out to the container bottom, and also eliminates the space between the container and the cover, improves grinding efficiency; 
> - after mounted the containers on the machine, fasten tight the big roller, and stuck in the tenons.

5. Confirm the machine settings and start homogenizing;

> - Frequency : 30 hits / sec ( maximum frequency )
> - Time : 2.0 mins &times; 3

6. Centrifuge at room temperature ( > 15000 rpm, 20 mins ) to bring down the bubbles;

7. Dry bath ( 60&deg;C, > 1 hour );

8. Add <b style='color:orange'>5 M NaCl</b> (same volume with the extraction buffer, therefore the NaCl final concentration will be 2.5 M);

9. Centrifuge at room temperature ( > 15000 rpm, 20 mins ) to bring down the remaining tissues; 

10. Take the supernatant (around 90% of the supernatant volume) carefully to new 1.5 mL eppendorf;

11. Add <b style='color:orange'>isopropanol</b> (around 0.7 volume of the supernatant) into the supernatant, leave overnight at -20&deg;C;

12. Centrifuge at 4&deg;C ( > 15000 rpm, 20 mins ) to bring down the DNA;

13. Discard the supernatant carefully. Do not touch the tube bottom, which sticking with the DNA palette;

14. Add <b style='color:orange'>70% ethanol</b> and gently invert the tube;

15. Centrifuge at 4&deg;C ( > 15000 rpm, 20 mins ) to bring down the DNA;

16. Discard the ethanol carefully with small pipette;

17. Dry bath at 60&deg;C for around 10 mins, the ethanol should be totally gone;

18. Add 50 &micro;L <b style='color:orange'>DNase-free water</b> and dry bath at 60&deg;C for around 10 mins to dissolve the DNA palette;

19. After the DNA was fully dissolved, slightly centrifuge at room temperature to bring down all solution on the tube wall;

20. Check the DNA concentration and quality.

### Wavelength detection
| Wavelength (nm) | Detected Compound |
| :---: | :--- |
| 230 | EtOH, EDTA, carbohydrates, phenol, Guanidone HCL (for DNA isolation) |
| 260 | RNA,ssDNA, dsDNA, guanidine isothiocyabate (for RNA isolation) |
| 270 | Phenolic solution (TRIzol for RNA isolation) |
| 280 | Protein, phenol, other contamination |

### Ideal wavelength ratio (quality indicator):
| Nucleic acid | 260 / 280 | 260 / 230 | 260 / 270 |
| :---:        | :---:     | :---:     | :---:     |

## Stock solution protocol:

### <sup>&#8251;</sup> Tris-HCl stock solution ( 1 M )

To prepare a 1 M solution of Tris-HCl,

1. Dissolve 121.1 g of Tris base in 800 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O;
2. Adjust the pH to the desired value by adding concentrated HCl;
3. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature before making final adjustments to the pH;
4. Adjust the volume of the solution to 1 L with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Dispense into aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving.

| pH    | 12N HCl addition |
| :---: | :---:            |

| 7.6   | 60 mL            |
| 8.0   | 42 mL            |

### <sup>&dagger;</sup> EDTA stock solution 

> EDTA ( Ethylenediamenetetraacetic acid )

To prepare EDTA at 0.5 M (pH 8.0), 

1. Add 186.1 g of disodium EDTA &bullet; 2H<sub>2</sub>O to 800 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O;
2. Stir vigorously on a magnetic stirrer to dissolve the EDTA;
3. Adjust the pH to 8.0 with NaOH (~ 20 g of NaOH pellets);

> Note: The disodium salt of EDTA will not go into solution until the pH is adjusted to ~ 8.0 by the addition of NaOH.

4. Dispense into aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving.

### <sup>&sect;</sup> SDS stock solution ( 10% )

> Sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate

To prepare a 10% (w/v) solution,

1. Dissolve 100 g of electropheresis-grade SDS in 900 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O;
2. Heat to 68&deg;C and stir with a magnetic stirrer to assist dissolution.
If necessary, adjust the pH to 7.2 by adding a few drops of concentrated HCl;
3. Adjust the volume to 1 L with ddH<sub>2</sub>O;
4. Store at room temperature. Sterilization is not necessary. 
<b style='color:red'>DO NOT</b> autoclave.

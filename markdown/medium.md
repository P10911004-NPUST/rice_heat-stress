 (optional) The gelling agent: <a href='https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/TW/en/product/sigma/p8169'>Phytagel ( P8169 )</a> &xrarr; 2 g / L ( 0.2% ). Located at &#8552;.

The final pH should be around 5.75 ~ 5.80. Autoclave under 121&deg;C for 20 mins.

<sup>&#8251;</sup> KOH is used for pH adjustment. 
To prepare 5 M KOH solution, dilute 330 g of 85% KOH in 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Since KOH releases heat during dissolution, it is important to add the KOH granules into the water gradually and slowly.

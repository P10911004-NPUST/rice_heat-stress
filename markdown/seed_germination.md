# Rice seed germination

## 1. Break dormancy
1. Dehusked the seeds. Select only seeds that are well-developed, fully-filled, clean, and transparent. 
2. Incubate the seeds in dark under 50&deg;C for 24 ~ 48 hours.

## 2. Sterilization
1. Soak the seeds in 3% bleach solution ( add one drop of detergent ) and keep gently inverting / shaking for 30 minutes.
2. Wash at least 6 times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, until bubbles are completely gone.

## 3. Priming and imbibition
1. Soak the seeds in 3% KNO<sub>3</sub> solution under room temperature for 24 hours.
2. Soak the seeds in 1 ~ 2% Plant Preservative Mixture&trade; ( PPM&trade; ) solution for 16 ~ 24 hours.

## 4. Sowing
Sow the seeds on suitable medium.  
> Optional: Add 0.05 ~ 0.2% ( v / v ) PPM&trade; to the medium, if it is difficult to control contamination. The PPM&trade; can be autoclaved together with the media.

(optional) The gelling agent: <a href='https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/TW/en/product/sigma/g1910'>Gelzan (G1910)</a> or <a href='https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/TW/en/product/sigma/p8169'>Phytagel ( P8169 )</a> &xrarr; 1.5 g / L ( 0.15% ). Located at &#8544; or &#8552;. Generally, we make 400 mL per bottle, so weigh 0.6 g / 400 mL for each bottle.

The final pH should be around 5.7 ~ 5.8. Autoclave under 121&deg;C for 20 mins.

<sup>&#8251;</sup> KOH is used for pH adjustment. 
To prepare 5 M KOH solution, dilute 330 g of 85% KOH in 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Since KOH releases heat during dissolution, it is important to add the KOH granules into the water gradually and slowly.

# Rice seed germination

## 1. Priming
1. Dehusked the seeds. Select only seeds that are well-developed, fully-filled, clean, and transparent. 
2. Place the seeds in dark under 50&deg;C for 48 hours.

## 2. Sterilization
1. Soak the seeds in 3% bleach solution ( add one drop of detergent ) and keep gently inverting / shaking for 30 minutes.
2. Wash at least 6 times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, until bubbles are completely gone.
3. Optional: Soak the seeds in 1 ~ 2% Plant Preservative Mixture&trade; ( PPM&trade; ) solution for 16 hours.
4. Close the container lid and move to laminar flow carbinet. The subsequent step should be done under sterile environment.
5. Soak the seeds with 75% ethanol for 30 secs.
6. Wash the seeds with ddH<sub>2</sub>O at least 3 times.

## 3. Imbibition
Soak the seeds in 0.5% KNO<sub>3</sub> solution under room temperature for 48 hours.

## 4. Sowing
Sow the seeds on suitable medium.  
> Optional: Add 0.05 ~ 0.2% ( v / v ) PPM&trade; to the medium, if difficult to control contamination. The PPM&trade; can be autoclaved with the media.

| :--------               | :---:          | :---:                | :---:          |
| MS basal salt           | &mdash;        | 8.66 g               | &#8545;        |
| MES hydrate             | &mdash;        | 2 g                  | &#8545;        |
| PPM&trade; (optional)   | 100%           | 1 mL                 | 4&deg;C ( a )  |
| KOH <sup>&#8251;</sup>  | 5 M            | ~ 700 &micro;L       | &#8550;        |
| ddH<sub>2</sub>O        | &mdash;        | ~ 1 L                |                |

The final pH should be 5.7 ~ 5.8.

<sup>&#8251;</sup> KOH is used for pH adjustment. To prepare 5 M KOH solution, dilute 330 g of 85% KOH in 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O.
Since KOH will release heat during dissolution, it is important to add the KOH granule into the water slowly.
